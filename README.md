# little-test

this is a little doo-hickey test that involves "initializing" player client scripts via the server *(not really, it just puts them into StarterPlayerScripts)*, a basic remoteevent system, and a very basic tag-making module
made in about an hour, including fiddling around with GitHub/VSCode/Rojo *(actual programming time took under 10 mins LOL)*
